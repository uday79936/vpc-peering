## üìò What Is VPC Peering?
A VPC peering connection allows two VPCs to communicate as if they are part of the same private network, using only private IP addresses. The data remains on the AWS global network, never traverses the public internet, and doesn‚Äôt rely on Internet Gateways, VPNs, or separate hardware 

Peering supports intra-account, inter-account, and inter-region setups, as long as the CIDR blocks don‚Äôt overlap 


## ‚úÖ Benefits of VPC Peering

No single point of failure or bottleneck; peering leverages native infrastructure 

Minimal cost: Free for AZ-local traffic; cross-AZ/region data transfers incur minimal fees

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set It Up (Same Account, Same Region)
## 1. Create VPCs
Use the console or CLI to create your two VPCs (e.g., AjaVPC and IbmVPC) with separate non-overlapping CIDRs, such as 10.0.0.0/16 and 192.168.0.0/16 

## 2. Establish Peering Connection:

Navigate to VPC ‚Üí Peering Connections ‚Üí Create Peering Connection, choose the Requester (AjaVPC) and Accepter (IbmVPC), then click Create. The request status will be Pending 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

## 3. Accept the Request:

Go to the Peering Connections list, select the request, then choose Actions ‚Üí Accept Request 

## 4. Update Route Tables:

In each VPC‚Äôs route table, add a route for the other VPC‚Äôs CIDR via the peering connection (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16 ‚Üí pcx-xxxx and vice versa)

## 5. Adjust Security Groups:

Ensure both EC2 instances‚Äô Security Groups allow Inbound ICMP (ping) and SSH from the peer VPC‚Äôs CIDR block 
Medium.

## 6. Test Connectivity:

## SSH into EC2-A and run:

```
ping 192.168.1.100  # EC2-B's private IP
```
## Screenshots:

You should receive ping replies if everything‚Äôs configured properly
